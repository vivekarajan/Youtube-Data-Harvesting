# Youtube-Data-Harvesting
Here, I'm working on a streamlit user interface project for YOUTUBE data harvesting. Using a YouTube API key, this project retrieves data from YouTube and stores it in a MySQL database. then it pulls data from MySQL and generates a response for each of the ten example queries. Finally, an analysis chart for the example problem I took is displayed.
